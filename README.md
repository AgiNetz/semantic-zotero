# Semantic Zotero Plugin
Semantic Zotero integrates Zotero with Semantic Scholar to fetch and display references related to a selected paper. You can then add them to your library directly from Zotero along with the full-text PDF. For now, the visuals are pretty barebones, I will update when I have time.
